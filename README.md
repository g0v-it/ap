g0v-it ontologies
==================
Semantic Web application profiles, ontologies and controlled vocabularies used in g0v-it projects.


## Application profiles

Application profiles are restrictions to the usage of existing ontologies designed for a specific applications family

- **[fr-ap](fr-ap/)**: an application  profile to annotate public administration Financial reports. 

## Ontologies and controlled vocabularies

According with [W3C Semantic Web Standards](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/ontology), "there is no clear division between what is referred to as “vocabularies” and “ontologies”. The trend is to use the word “ontology” for more complex, and possibly quite formal collection of terms, whereas “vocabulary” is used when such strict formalism is not necessarily used or only in a very loose sense."

g0v-it projects try to reuse existing ontologies.

Following new vocabularies are defined:

- [mef](mef/): a vocabulary to annotate the *Legge di Bilancio* and other MEF reports
- [agcom](): a vocabulary to annotate AGCOM data
- [auditel](): a vocabulary to annotate AUDITEL data
