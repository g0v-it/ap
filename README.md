g0v-it ontologies
==================
Semantic Web ontologies and controlled vocabularies used in g0v-it projects.

**What is an ontology?**

An ontology is made up of formal statements about Classes (i.e. sets of things) and Properties (ways that things relate to other things) and
allows to provide a strong semantic to data.

According with [W3C Semantic Web Standards](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/ontology), "there is no clear division between what is referred to as “vocabularies” and “ontologies”. The trend is to use the word “ontology” for more complex, and possibly quite formal collection of terms, whereas “vocabulary” is used when such strict formalism is not necessarily used or only in a very loose sense."

g0v-it projects try to reuse existing ontologies as much as possible.

Following new vocabularies are defined:

- [mef](mef/): a vocabulary to annotate the Italian Budget
- agcom: a vocabulary to annotate AGCOM data TBD
- auditel: a vocabulary to annotate AUDITEL data TBD
