g0v-it ontologies
==================
Semantic Web application profiles, ontologies and controlled vocabularies used in g0v-it projects.


## Application profiles

Application profiles are restrictions to the usage of existing ontologies designed for a specific applications family

- **[fr-ap](fr-ap/)**: an application  profile to annotate financial report. 
   This profile is used by financial report visualization application 
   (es. https://budget.g0v.it and https://inps.g0v.it ).

## ontologies and controlled vocabularies

According with [W3C Semantic Web Standards](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/ontology), "there is no clear division between what is referred to as “vocabularies” and “ontologies”. The trend is to use the word “ontology” for more complex, and possibly quite formal collection of terms, whereas “vocabulary” is used when such strict formalism is not necessarily used or only in a very loose sense."

g0v-it projects try to reuse existing ontologies.

Following new vocabularies are defined:

- **[agcom](agcom/)**: a vocabulary to annotate AGCOM data, it contains SKOS schemes 
   and extends Data Cube Vocabulary
- **[auditel](auditel/)**: a vocabulary to annotate AUDITEL data, it extends Data Cube Vocabulary

agicom and auditel vocabularies are used in [data-agcom](https://github.com/g0v-it/data-agicom) platform.
