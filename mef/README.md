g0v mef ontology
==============

Status: **unstable**

The [Italian budget](https://openbdap.mef.gov.it/it/BdS) is a set of living financial reports defined by the Economy and Finance Administration of the Italian Government (i.e. *Ministero dell'Economia e delle Finance* - **MEF**).

The *g0v mef ontology* is a simplified conceptual model developed by the [g0v.it civic hacking team](https://g0v.it)
to represent the Italian budget with its historical perspective;
*g0v mef ontology*  defines the sets of things that are of interest in describing the MEF world, and the ways that those things can relate to one another. 

In this way, *g0v mef ontology* adds formal meaning to the raw data that are published in the [BDAP Open Data Catalog](https://bdap-opendata.mef.gov.it/catalog) by MEF.

## Accessing g0v mef ontology

*g0v mef ontology* is technically expressed in the RDF/OWL - the language of the World Wide Web for machine readable inference processing. 
It is very expressive and linguistically aligned with how people think and speak - but expressed in a way that machines can process 
based on mathematical formulas and description logic. By taking advantage of the RDF/OWL Web standard, *g0v mef ontology* uses machine 
intelligence and network graph capabilities to express, enrich, classify and link data in ways that were not previously possible.

The RDF/OWL file can be embedded in computer applications that can perform logic functions such as inferring classifications and relationships.

You can access this ontology by:
 
- editing the *g0v mef ontology* [RDF source file](mef.rdf) serialized using XML RDF notation. 
- navigate the *g0v mef ontology* with [WebOwl](http://visualdataweb.de/webvowl/#iri=http://w3id.org/g0v/it/mef)
- browse the html document generated by [LODE](http://150.146.207.114/lode/extract?url=http://w3id.org/g0v/it/mef)
- edit *g0v mef ontology* with [Standford University Protégeè](https://protege.stanford.edu/)

 
## The mef vocabulary

The namespace for *g0v mef ontology* is *http://w3id.org/g0v/it/mef#* and the suggested prefix is *mef:*

The mef Vocabulary is compatible with  the [Financial Report vocabulary (fr)](http://linkeddata.center/botk-fr/v1) and with the [SKOS vocabulary](http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core):

- the class **mef:Budget** describes the Italian Budget Report and is derived from *fr:FinancialReport]* ;
- the classes **mef:Fact**, **mef:Component**, and **mef:StructuralComponent** are from 
homonymous properties in the *fr:* vocabulary
- the class **mef:Taxonomy** is derived from *skos:ConceptScheme*
- **mef:isPartOf** and **mef:inTaxonomy** properties derive from skos:broader and skos:inScheme properties.

Here's a UML big picture:

### Budget life cycle and version id

The Italian budget (mef:Budget) exists in four main states:

- *Disegno di Legge di Bilancio* (mef:DisegnoLeggeBilancio): published yearly by the Italian government (usually at the beginning of November) and presented to the Italian Parliament and to the EU commission for approval.
- *Legge di Bilancio* (mef:LeggeBilancio): approved by the Italian Parliament usually before the end of the year
- *Previsioni di Assestamento di Bilancio* (mef:AssestamentoBilancio): last revision of the approved by the Italian Parliament usually at the mid of the year
- *Rendiconto* (mef:Rendiconto): approved by the Italian Parliament as a consolidated view of the budget data

Each report has an extension of one year (mef:esercizio) with range from 2017 to 2099 inclusive.
**Why from 2017?** because the Italian Parliament in 2017 defined the budget structure as described in mef ontology. 


The **mef:versionId** property captures the budget life cycle using the convention {YEAR}{REPORT TYPE}:

- {YEAR} refers to the last two digits of the mefesercizio of the financial document, ranging from 17 to 99,
- {REPORT TYPE} refers to the main budget state: 
    - **D** means *Disegno di Legge di Bilancio*, 
    - **L** means *Legge di Bilancio*,  
    - **P** means *Provvedimento di Assestamento*, 
    - **R** means *Rendiconto*

e.g.:

- *20D* means the last release of the *Disegno di Legge di Bilancio* relative to 2020 year
- *19L* means the release of *Legge di Bilancio* relative to 2019 year as approved by the Italian Parliament in Dec. 2018
- *18R* means Rendiconto* of 2018 year as approved by the Italian Parliament in 2019



### Taxonomies

The budget report is made by facts (mef:Fact) that are aggregated in components (mef:Components)

All components and facts concepts relate (mef:inTaxonomy) to one or more classification scheme (mef:Taxonomy):

- taxonomies related to expenses (S):
    - mef:hasSchemeSMMPACP (**Ministero->Missione->Programma->Azione->Capitolo di spesa->Piano di gestione**)
    - mef:hasSchemeSMRMP (**Ministero->Centro di responsabilità->Missione->Programma**)
    - mef:hasSchemeSMTC (**Ministero->Titolo spesa->Categoria**)
    - mef:hasSchemeSTCCP (**Titolo di spesa->Categoria->Capitolo->Piano di gestione**)
    - mef:hasSchemeSMP (**Missione->Programma**)
- taxonomies related to incomings (E):	
    - mef:hasSchemeETNT (**Titolo entrata->Natura->Tipologia**)
    - mef:hasSchemeETTPCA (**Titolo entrata->Tipologia->Provento->Capitolo->Articolo**)
    


### Axioms 

In addition to the restrictions specified in the OWL file, the following axioms apply:

- *mef:competenza*, *mef:cassa* and *mef:residui* that are monetary metrics always expressed in EURO as defined in http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/currency/EUR; 
- the mef:esercizio property represents the temporal period of one year ranging from 1 January to 31 December as define din https://github.com/epimorphics/IntervalServer/blob/master/interval-uris.md
- all mef:StructuralComponent individuals, refer to the same period of the related budget;
- the the value of the component metrics is computed as the sum of the related facts
- the budget taxonomies can be inferred from static rules ( see [building rule](taxonomy-axioms/build.construct) and [linking rule](taxonomy-axioms/links.construct))

### Mappings

mef ontology can be mapped safely to:

- [SKOS](mappings/mef2skos/),
- [Financial Report](mappings/mef2fr/), 
- [Dublin Core](mappings/mef2dct/)
