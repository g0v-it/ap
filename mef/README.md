g0v mef ontology
==============

Status: **unstable**

The [Italian budget](https://openbdap.mef.gov.it/it/BdS) is a set of living financial reports defined by the Economy and Finance Administration of the Italian Government (i.e. *Ministero dell'Economia e delle Finance* - **MEF**).

The *g0v mef ontology*, that's developed by the [g0v.it civic hacking team](https://g0v.it), represent the Italian budget's historical perspective through a shared, formal and machine-readable conceptualization;
*g0v mef ontology* defines all concepts that are relevant to describe MEF's knowledge domain and the ways in which those concepts relate each other. 

The purpose of *g0v mef ontology* is to add formal meaning to the raw data that are published in the [BDAP Open Data Catalog](https://bdap-opendata.mef.gov.it/catalog) by MEF, turning Open Data into Linked Open Data.

## Accessing g0v mef ontology

*g0v mef ontology* is based and developed following standards and is technically expressed in the RDF/OWL - the Semantic Web languages designed to represent rich and complex knowledge about things. 
The knowledge is organized similarly to how normally people think and speak but through the use of these languages it's expressed in a way that also machines can "understand", process and enrich using inference reasoning. This happens because OWL, the most expressive language to model ontologies, is based on DLs (*Description Logics*) and every specification in OWL corresponds to description logics' axioms.
By taking advantage of the RDF/OWL Web standard, *g0v mef ontology* uses machine intelligence and network graph capabilities to express, enrich, classify and link data in ways that were not previously possible.

The RDF/OWL file can be embedded in computer applications that can perform logic functions such as inferring classifications and relationships.

You can access this ontology by:
 
- editing the *g0v mef ontology* [RDF source file](mef.rdf) serialized using XML RDF notation;
- navigate the *g0v mef ontology* with [WebOwl](http://visualdataweb.de/webvowl/#iri=http://w3id.org/g0v/it/mef);
- browse the html document generated by [LODE](http://150.146.207.114/lode/extract?url=http://w3id.org/g0v/it/mef);
- edit *g0v mef ontology* with [Standford University Protégeè](https://protege.stanford.edu/).

 
## The mef vocabulary

The namespace for *g0v mef ontology* is *http://w3id.org/g0v/it/mef#* and the suggested prefix is *mef:*

The mef Vocabulary is compatible with  the [Financial Report vocabulary (fr)](http://linkeddata.center/botk-fr/v1) and with the [SKOS vocabulary](http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core):

- the class **mef:Budget** describes the Italian Budget Report and is derived from *fr:FinancialReport]* ;
- the classes **mef:Fact**, **mef:Component**, and **mef:StructuralComponent** are from 
homonymous properties in the *fr:* vocabulary;
- the class **mef:Taxonomy** is derived from *skos:ConceptScheme*;
- **mef:isPartOf** and **mef:inTaxonomy** properties derive from skos:broader and skos:inScheme properties.

Here's UML big picture:

### Budget life cycle and version id

The Italian budget (mef:Budget) exists in four main states:

- *Disegno di Legge di Bilancio* (mef:DisegnoLeggeBilancio): published yearly by the Italian government (usually at the beginning of November) and presented to the Italian Parliament and to the EU commission for approval;
- *Legge di Bilancio* (mef:LeggeBilancio): approved by the Italian Parliament usually before the end of the year;
- *Previsioni di Assestamento di Bilancio* (mef:AssestamentoBilancio): last revision of the approved by the Italian Parliament usually at the mid of the year;
- *Rendiconto* (mef:Rendiconto): approved by the Italian Parliament as a consolidated view of the budget data.

Each report has an extension of one year (mef:esercizio) with range from 2017 to 2099 inclusive.
2017 is an important year because the Italian Parliament in 2017 defined the budget structure as described in mef ontology. 


The **mef:versionId** property captures the budget life cycle using the convention {YEAR}{REPORT TYPE}:

- {YEAR} refers to the last two digits of the mef:esercizio of the financial document, ranging from 17 to 99.
- {REPORT TYPE} refers to the main budget state: 
    - **D** means *Disegno di Legge di Bilancio*;
    - **L** means *Legge di Bilancio*;
    - **P** means *Provvedimento di Assestamento*;
    - **R** means *Rendiconto*.

e.g.:

- *20D* means the last release of the *Disegno di Legge di Bilancio* relative to 2020 year;
- *19L* means the release of *Legge di Bilancio* relative to 2019 year as approved by the Italian Parliament in Dec. 2018;
- *18R* means Rendiconto* of 2018 year as approved by the Italian Parliament in 2019.



### Taxonomies

The budget report is made by facts (mef:Fact) that are aggregated in components (mef:Components)

All components and facts concepts relate (mef:inTaxonomy) to one or more classification scheme (mef:Taxonomy):

- taxonomies related to expenses (S):
    - mef:hasSchemeSMMPACP (**Ministero->Missione->Programma->Azione->Capitolo di spesa->Piano di gestione**);
    - mef:hasSchemeSMRMP (**Ministero->Centro di responsabilità->Missione->Programma**);
    - mef:hasSchemeSMTC (**Ministero->Titolo spesa->Categoria**);
    - mef:hasSchemeSTCCP (**Titolo di spesa->Categoria->Capitolo->Piano di gestione**);
    - mef:hasSchemeSMP (**Missione->Programma**);
- taxonomies related to incomings (E):	
    - mef:hasSchemeETNT (**Titolo entrata->Natura->Tipologia**);
    - mef:hasSchemeETTPCA (**Titolo entrata->Tipologia->Provento->Capitolo->Articolo**).
    


### Axioms 

In addition to the restrictions specified in the OWL file, the following axioms apply:

- *mef:competenza*, *mef:cassa* and *mef:residui* that are monetary metrics always expressed in EURO as defined in http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/currency/EUR; 
- the mef:esercizio property represents the temporal period of one year ranging from 1 January to 31 December as define din https://github.com/epimorphics/IntervalServer/blob/master/interval-uris.md;
- all mef:StructuralComponent individuals, refer to the same period of the related budget;
- the the value of the component metrics is computed as the sum of the related facts;
- the budget taxonomies can be inferred from static rules ( see [building rule](taxonomy-axioms/build.construct) and [linking rule](taxonomy-axioms/links.construct)).

### Mappings

mef ontology can be mapped safely to:

- [SKOS](mappings/mef2skos/);
- [Financial Report](mappings/mef2fr/); 
- [Dublin Core](mappings/mef2dct/).
